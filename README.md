# Data Preperation, EDA and Visualization - Tabular & Time Series

This repository contains two distinct projects demonstrating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on **tabular data** and **time series data**. The objective of these notebooks is to experience with various EDA techniques, data preprocessing, visualizations, clustering, anomaly detection, and AutoML using Python.

## Tabular EDA

### Overview
The **Tabular EDA** notebook explores the process of data analysis on structured tabular data. This example uses a **Customer Segmentation** dataset, where various statistical and machine learning techniques are applied for feature exploration and pattern identification.

### Key Techniques and Features:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Missing value handling and outlier detection.
- Data visualization with histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
- Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features).
- KMeans clustering for pattern discovery.
- Anomaly detection in clusters.
- AutoML with AutoViML for model building.

### Requirements:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `autoviml`

## Time Series EDA

### Overview
The **Time Series EDA** notebook demonstrates the process of analyzing time-based data. It uses an **Electricity Consumption** dataset to apply common time series analysis techniques and to forecast future trends.

### Key Techniques and Features:
- Time series data visualization (e.g., hourly electricity consumption).
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering for time series (e.g., moving averages, lag features).
- KMeans clustering for time series segmentation.
- Anomaly detection based on cluster analysis.
- AutoML with AutoViML for time series forecasting.

### Requirements:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `autoviml`
- `folium`
- `kagglehub`
